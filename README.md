This repository contains examples and configurations for various network routing protocols, including RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, static, and dynamic routing. Each section provides detailed insights into configuring, optimizing, and troubleshooting these protocols.

RIP (Routing Information Protocol): RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol that determines the best path between networks based on hop count. This repository includes examples of how to configure RIP on Cisco routers and troubleshoot common RIP issues.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): OSPF is a link-state routing protocol that uses cost as its metric to find the optimal path. The repository provides configurations and examples of OSPF setups in various topologies, as well as optimization techniques to improve network performance.

VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network): VLANs allow for logical grouping of network devices to enhance security, manage traffic, and minimize broadcast traffic. Examples in this repository demonstrate VLAN configuration on Cisco switches and troubleshooting tips for VLAN issues.

ACL (Access Control Lists): ACLs are essential for managing traffic by filtering based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports. They help control access and protect against malicious traffic. This repository covers ACL configurations on Cisco routers and switches, along with troubleshooting guidelines.

EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol): EIGRP, a Cisco proprietary protocol, uses a composite metric (bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load) to determine the best network path. Configurations and optimizations for EIGRP in various network topologies are included here to enhance network performance.

Static Routing: Static routing uses a fixed path for forwarding traffic, useful for networks without dynamic routing protocols or to override them. Examples and troubleshooting tips for configuring static routing on Cisco routers are provided.

Dynamic Routing: Dynamic routing protocols enable the automatic exchange of routing information between routers. This repository includes configurations for dynamic protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, and RIP, with examples showing how they can enhance network performance, reduce congestion, and improve availability.
